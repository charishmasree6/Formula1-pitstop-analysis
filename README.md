# 🏎️ Formula 1 Pit Stop Analysis (2000–2023)
This project analyzes Formula 1 pit stop data from 2000 to 2023 using Python and pandas in Jupyter Notebook. It explores how pit stop performance evolved over the years — by season, driver, and constructor — and visualizes insights through clean and clear plots.

## 📊 Project Highlights

### ✅ Data Processing
- Loaded and cleaned raw `.csv` files
- Merged pit stop data with:
  - Driver details (`drivers.csv`)
  - Race details (`races.csv`)
  - Constructor/team info (`constructors.csv`)
- Converted milliseconds to seconds for readability

### 📈 Visual Analysis
- 📉 Average pit stop duration per year (2000–2023)
- 🏎️ Top 10 fastest teams by average pit stop time
- 👨‍💼 Top drivers with the fastest pit stops
- 🗺️ Track-wise pit stop patterns across races
